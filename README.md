this website is not meant as hate towards StressLevelZero, but rather to excite some of my friends in a positive, civilized manner.
i myself am a developer (of sorts), and you should not see this countdown as a guarantee, but rather as a hopeful statement.
Bonelab is also a game which me and my friends are very excited for, but joke about as a meme, since i have been especially excited about it,
so this website is somewhat satirical of that, and the general negative overhyping-train that sometimes congregates around SLZ's games.

if someone reading this works at stresslevelzero, i want to say you guys are doing an amazing job and can take as long as you need, be it even years.
